# Quick Start Debian 9 using crm

This quick start purpose is to help you to build your first cluster to
experiment with. It does *not* implement various good practices related to
your system, Pacemaker or PostgreSQL. This quick start alone is not enough.
During your journey in building a safe HA cluster, you must train about
security, network, PostgreSQL, Pacemaker, PAF, etc.
In regard with PAF, make sure to read carefully documentation from
<https://clusterlabs.github.io/PAF/documentation.html>.

This tutorial is based on Debian 9.1, using Pacemaker 1.1.16 and
the `crm` command version 2.3.2.

## Repository setup

To install PostgreSQL and PAF, this tutorial uses the PGDG repository
maintained by the PostgreSQL community (and actually Debian maintainers). Here
is how to add it:

~~~
cat <<EOF >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ stretch-pgdg main
EOF
~~~

Now, update your local apt cache:

~~~
apt install ca-certificates gpg
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | apt-key add
apt update
apt install pgdg-keyring
~~~


## Network setup

The cluster we are about to build includes three servers called `srv1`,
`srv2` and `srv3`. IP addresses of these servers are `192.168.122.6x/24`.

> **NOTE**: It is essential to setup network redundancy, either at
> system level using eg. bonding or teaming, or at cluster level.
{: .notice}

The IP address `192.168.122.60`, called `pgsql-vip` in this tutorial, will be
set on the server hosting the primary PostgreSQL instance.

During the cluster setup, we use the node names in various places,
make sure all your server hostnames can be resolved to the correct IPs. We
usually set this in the `/etc/hosts` file:

~~~
192.168.122.60 pgsql-vip
192.168.122.61 srv1
192.168.122.62 srv2
192.168.122.63 srv3
~~~

Now, the three servers should be able to ping each others, eg.:

~~~
root@srv1:~# for s in srv1 srv2 srv3; do ping -W1 -c1 $s; done| grep icmp_seq
64 bytes from srv1 (192.168.122.61): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.028 ms
64 bytes from srv2 (192.168.122.62): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.296 ms
64 bytes from srv3 (192.168.122.63): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.351 ms
~~~

Make sure hostnames are correctly set on each nodes, or use `hostnamectl`.
Eg.:

~~~bash
hostnamectl set-hostname srv1
~~~


## PostgreSQL and Cluster stack installation

Run this whole chapter on __ALL__ nodes.

Let's install everything we need: PostgreSQL, Pacemaker, cluster related
packages and PAF:

~~~bash
apt install --no-install-recommends pacemaker fence-agents crmsh net-tools
apt install postgresql-9.6 postgresql-contrib-9.6 postgresql-client-9.6
apt install resource-agents-paf
~~~

We add the `--no-install-recommends` because the apt tools are setup by default
to install all recommended packages in addition to the usual dependencies. This
might be fine in most case, but we want to keep this quick start small, easy
and clear. Installing recommended packages requires some more attention on
other subjects not related to this document (eg. setting up some IPMI daemon).

By default, Debian set up the instances to put the temporary activity
statistics inside a sub folder of `/var/run/postgresql/`. This sub folder is
created by the debian specific tool `pg_ctlcluster` on instance startup.

PAF only use tools provided by the PostgreSQL projects, no other ones specifics
to some other packages or operating system. That means that this required sub
folder set up in `stats_temp_directory` is never created and leads to error on
instance startup by Pacemaker.

To create this sub folder on system initialization, we need to extend the
existing `systemd-tmpfiles` configuration for `postgresql` to add it. In our
environment `stats_temp_directory` is set
to `/var/run/postgresql/9.6-main.pg_stat_tmp`, so we create the following
file:

~~~bash
cat <<EOF > /etc/tmpfiles.d/postgresql-part.conf
# Directory for PostgreSQL temp stat files
d /var/run/postgresql/9.6-main.pg_stat_tmp 0700 postgres postgres - -
EOF
~~~

To take this file in consideration immediately without rebooting the server,
run the following command:

~~~bash
systemd-tmpfiles --create /etc/tmpfiles.d/postgresql-part.conf
~~~


## PostgreSQL setup

> **WARNING**: building PostgreSQL standby is not the main subject here. The
> following steps are __**quick and dirty, VERY DIRTY**__. They lack of
> security, WAL retention and so on. Rely on the
> [PostgreSQL documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/index.html)
> for a proper setup.
{: .warning}

The resource agent requires the PostgreSQL instances to be already set up,
ready to start and standbys ready to replicate. Make sure to setup your primary
on your preferred node to host it: during the very first startup of the
cluster, PAF detects the primary based on its shutdown status.

Moreover, it requires a `recovery.conf` template ready to use. You can create
a `recovery.conf` file suitable to your needs, the only requirements are:

* have `standby_mode = on`
* have `recovery_target_timeline = 'latest'`
* a `primary_conninfo` with an `application_name` set to the node name

Last but not least, make sure each instance is not able to replicate with
itself! A scenario exists where the primary IP address `pgsql-vip` will be on
the same node than a standby for a very short lap of time!

> **NOTE**: as `recovery.conf.pcmk` and `pg_hba.conf` files are different
> on each node, make sure to keep them out of the `$PGDATA` so you do not have
> to deal with them (or worst: forget to edit them) each time you rebuild a
> standby! Luckily, Debian packaging already enforce this as configuration files
> are all located in `/etc/postgresql`.
{: .notice}

Here are some quick steps to build your primary PostgreSQL instance and its
standbys. This quick start considers `srv1` is the preferred primary node.

On all nodes:

~~~bash
su - postgres

cd /etc/postgresql/9.6/main/
cat <<EOP >> postgresql.conf

listen_addresses = '*'
wal_level = replica
max_wal_senders = 10
hot_standby = on
hot_standby_feedback = on
logging_collector = on
EOP

cat <<EOP >> pg_hba.conf
# forbid self-replication
host replication postgres 192.168.122.60/32 reject
host replication postgres $(hostname -s) reject

#Â allow any standby connection
host replication postgres 0.0.0.0/0 trust
EOP

cat <<EOP > recovery.conf.pcmk
standby_mode = on
primary_conninfo = 'host=192.168.122.60 application_name=$(hostname -s)'
recovery_target_timeline = 'latest'
EOP

exit
~~~

On `srv1`, the primary, restart the instance and give it the primary vIP address
(adapt the `eth0` interface to your system):

~~~bash
systemctl restart postgresql@9.6-main

ip addr add 192.168.122.60/24 dev eth0
~~~

Now, on each standby (`srv2` and `srv3` here), we have to cleanup the instance
created by the package and clone the primary. E.g.:

~~~bash
systemctl stop postgresql@9.6-main
su - postgres

rm -rf 9.6/main/
pg_basebackup -h pgsql-vip -D ~postgres/9.6/main/ -X stream -P

cp /etc/postgresql/9.6/main/recovery.conf.pcmk ~postgres/9.6/main/recovery.conf

exit

systemctl start postgresql@9.6-main
~~~

Check your three instances are replicating as expected (in processes, logs,
`pg_stat_replication`, etc).

Finally, make sure to stop the PostgreSQL services __everywhere__ and to
disable them, as Pacemaker will take care of starting/stopping everything for
you during cluster normal cluster operations. Start with the primary:

~~~bash
systemctl disable --now postgresql@9.6-main
echo disabled > /etc/postgresql/9.6/main/start.conf
~~~

And remove the vIP address from `srv1`:

~~~bash
ip addr del 192.168.122.60/24 dev eth0
~~~


## Cluster pre-requisites

It is advised to keep Pacemaker off on server boot. It helps the administrator
to investigate after a node fencing before Pacemaker starts and potentially
enters in a death match with the other nodes. Make sure to disable Corosync as
well to avoid unexpected behaviors. Run this on all nodes:

~~~
systemctl disable corosync # important!
systemctl disable pacemaker
~~~

Moreover, on Pacemaker and Corosync installation, Debian packaging
automatically creates and start a dummy isolated node. We need to move it out
of our way by stopping it before creating the real one:

~~~
systemctl stop pacemaker.service corosync.service
~~~

This guide uses the cluster management tool `crm` to ease the creation and
setup of a cluster. It allows to create the cluster from command line, without
editing configuration files or XML by hands.

`crm` relies heavily on SSH to transfer files between nodes and execute remote
commands. It requires the system user `root` to be able to connect to all
remote nodes without password. The easiest way to go is to generate a SSH keys
on each node and put the public part in the `~root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file
on other nodes.

On all nodes:

~~~
ssh-keygen # do no set any password
ssh-copy-id srv1
ssh-copy-id srv2
ssh-copy-id srv3
~~~


## Cluster creation

The `crm` cli tool is able to create and start the whole cluster for us. From
one of the nodes, run the following command:

~~~bash
crm cluster init srv1 srv2 srv3
~~~

This command creates the `/etc/corosync/corosync.conf` file and propagate
it everywhere. This file must **always** be the same among all nodes. For more
information about it, read the `corosync.conf(5)` manual page.

Your cluster is now supposed to run, the following command should prove it,
just give it some time for the node to negotiate between them:

~~~
crm status
~~~

If this command returns an error after some time, start the cluster yourself by
hand running the following command on all nodes:

~~~
crm cluster start
~~~

After some seconds of startup and cluster membership stuff, you should be able
to see your three nodes up in `crm_mon` (or `crm status`):

~~~bash
root@srv1:~# crm_mon -n1D

Node srv1: online
Node srv2: online
Node srv3: online
~~~

{: .warning}

Now the cluster run, let's start with some basic setup of the cluster. Run
the following command from **one** node only (the cluster takes care of
broadcasting the configuration on all nodes):

~~~bash
crm conf <<EOC
rsc_defaults resource-stickiness=10
rsc_defaults migration-threshold=5
EOC
~~~

This sets two default values for resources we create in the next chapter:

* `resource-stickiness`: adds a sticky score for the resource on its current
  node. It helps avoiding a resource move back and forth between nodes where it
  has the same score.
* `migration-threshold`: this controls how many time the cluster tries to
  recover a resource on the same node before moving it on another one.


## Node fencing

The most important resource in your cluster is the one able to fence a
node. Please, stop reading this quick start and read our fencing
documentation page before building your cluster. Take a deep breath, and read:
[http://clusterlabs.github.com/PAF/fencing.html]({{ site.baseurl }}/fencing.html).

> **WARNING**: I really mean it. You need fencing. PAF is expecting fencing to
> work in your cluster. Without fencing, you will experience cluster refusing
> to move anything, even with stonith disabled, or worst, a split brain if you
> bend it hard enough to make it work anyway.
> If you don't mind taking time rebuilding a database with corrupt and/or
> incoherent data and constraints, that's fine though.
{: .warning}

> **NOTE**: if you can't have active fencing, look as storage base death or
> watchdog methods. They are both described in the fencing documentation.
{: .notice}

In this tutorial, we choose to create one fencing resource per node to fence.
They are called `fence_vm_xxx`and use the fencing agent `fence_virsh`, allowing
to power on or off a virtual machine using the `virsh` command through a ssh
connection to the hypervisor.

> **WARNING**: unless you build your PoC cluster using libvirt for VM
> management, there's great chances you will need to use a different STONITH
> agent. The stonith setup is provided as a simple example, be prepared to
> adjust it.
{: .warning}

Now you've been warned again and again, let's populating the cluster with some
sample STONITH resources using virsh over ssh. First, we need to allow ssh
password-less authentication to `<user>@192.168.122.1` so these fencing
resource can work. Again, this is specific to this setup. Depending on your
fencing topology, you might not need this step. Run on all node:

~~~bash
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id <user>@192.168.122.1
~~~

Check the ssh connections are working as expected.

We can now create one STONITH resource for each node. Each fencing
resource will not be allowed to run on the node it is supposed to fence.
Note that in the `port` argument of the following commands, `srv[1-3]-d9` are 
the names of the virutal machines as known by libvirtd side. See manpage 
fence_virsh(8) for more infos.

~~~bash
crm conf<<EOC
primitive fence_vm_srv1 stonith:fence_virsh                   \
  params pcmk_host_check="static-list" pcmk_host_list="srv1"  \
         ipaddr="192.168.122.1" login="<user>"                \
         identity_file="/root/.ssh/id_rsa" port="srv1-d9"     \
  op monitor interval=10s

primitive fence_vm_srv2 stonith:fence_virsh                   \
  params pcmk_host_check="static-list" pcmk_host_list="srv2"  \
         ipaddr="192.168.122.1" login="<user>"                \
         identity_file="/root/.ssh/id_rsa" port="srv2-d9"     \
  op monitor interval=10s

primitive fence_vm_srv3 stonith:fence_virsh                   \
  params pcmk_host_check="static-list" pcmk_host_list="srv3"  \
         ipaddr="192.168.122.1" login="<user>"                \
         identity_file="/root/.ssh/id_rsa" port="srv3-d9"     \
  op monitor interval=10s

location fence_vm_srv1-avoids-srv1 fence_vm_srv1 -inf: srv1
location fence_vm_srv2-avoids-srv2 fence_vm_srv2 -inf: srv2
location fence_vm_srv3-avoids-srv3 fence_vm_srv3 -inf: srv3
EOC
~~~

Using `crm_mon` You should see the three resources appearing in your cluster
and being dispatched on nodes.


## Cluster resources

In this last chapter we create three resources: `pgsqld`, `pgsql-ha`
and `pgsql-pri-ip`.

The `pgsqld` defines the properties of a PostgreSQL instance: where it is
located, where are its binaries, its configuration files, how to montor it, and
so on.

The `pgsql-ha` resource controls all the PostgreSQL instances `pgsqld` in your
cluster, decides where the primary is promoted and where the standbys
are started.

The `pgsql-pri-ip` resource controls the `pgsql-vip` IP address. It is
started on the node hosting the PostgreSQL primary resource.

Now the fencing is working, we can add all other resources and constraints all
together in the same time:

  1. the PostgreSQL `pgsqld` resource
  2. the multistate `pgsql-ha` responsible to clone `pgsqld` everywhere and
     define the roles (`Master`/`Slave`) of each clone
  3. the IP address that must be started on the PostgreSQL primary node
  4. the collocation of the vIP address with the PostgreSQL primary instance
  5. the ordering constraints between the IP address and the primary instance

~~~
crm conf <<EOC

# 1. resource pgsqld

         recovery_template="/etc/postgresql/9.6/main/recovery.conf.pcmk"      \
         start_opts="-c config_file=/etc/postgresql/9.6/main/postgresql.conf" \
  op start timeout=60s                                                        \
  op stop timeout=60s                                                         \

  op notify timeout=60s

#Â 2. resource pgsql-ha
ms pgsql-ha pgsqld meta notify=true

# 3. the vIP address
primitive pgsql-pri-ip IPaddr2           \
  params ip=192.168.122.60 cidr_netmask=24 \
  op monitor interval=10s

# 4. colocation of the pgsql-ha master and the vIP address
colocation ip-with-pri inf: pgsql-pri-ip pgsql-ha:Master

# 5. ordering constraint
order promote-then-ip Mandatory:         \
  pgsql-ha:promote pgsql-pri-ip:start \
  sequential=true symmetrical=false

order demote-then-stop-ip Mandatory:   \
  pgsql-ha:demote pgsql-pri-ip:stop \
  sequential=true symmetrical=false

EOC
~~~

In step 5, the start/stop and promote/demote order for these resources must be
asymetrical: we __MUST__ keep the vIP on the primary during its demote process
so the standbies receive everything during its shutdown.

Note that the values for `timeout` and `interval` on each operation are based
on the minimum suggested value for PAF Resource Agent. These values should be
adapted depending on the context.


## Conclusion

Now you know the basics to build a Pacemaker cluster hosting some PostgreSQL
instances replicating with each others, you should probably check:

* [how to set up properly the PostgreSQL replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/high-availability.html)
* documentation about how to setup network bonding or teaming are popular on
  internet.  You can consult the Corosync documentation to support redundancy
  from there, but it best fits in the operating system layer.
* have a look at our basic
  [administration cookbooks for Debian using crm]({{ site.baseurl}}/Debian-8-admin-cookbook.html).
