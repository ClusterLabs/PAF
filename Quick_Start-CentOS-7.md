title: PostgreSQL Automatic Failover - Quick start CentOS 7
---

# Quick Start CentOS 7

This quick start tutorial is based on CentOS 7.2, using the `pcs` command.


## Network setup

The cluster we are about to build includes three servers called `srv1`,
`srv2` and `srv3`. Each of them have two network interfaces `eth0` and
`eth1`. IP addresses of these servers are `192.168.122.5x/24` on the first
interface, `192.168.123.5x/24` on the second one.

The IP address `192.168.122.50`, called `pgsql-vip` in this tutorial, will be set
on the server hosting the master PostgreSQL intance.

Considering the firewall, we have to allow the network traffic related to the
cluster and PostgreSQL to go through:

```
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=high-availability
firewall-cmd --add-service=high-availability
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=postgresql
firewall-cmd --add-service=postgresql
```

During the cluster setup, we use the cluster name in various places,
make sure all your server names can be resolved to the correct IPs. We usually
set this in the `/etc/hosts` file:

```
192.168.122.50 pgsql-vip
192.168.122.51 srv1
192.168.122.52 srv2
192.168.122.53 srv3
192.168.123.51 srv1-alt
192.168.123.52 srv2-alt
192.168.123.53 srv3-alt
```

Now, the three servers should be able to ping each others, eg.:

```
root@srv1:~# for s in srv1 srv2 srv3; do ping -W1 -c1 $s; done| grep icmp_seq
64 bytes from srv1 (192.168.122.51): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.028 ms
64 bytes from srv2 (192.168.122.52): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.296 ms
64 bytes from srv3 (192.168.122.53): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.351 ms
```

## PostgreSQL and Cluster stack installation

We are using the PostgreSQL packages from the PGDG repository. Here is how to
install and set up this repository on your system:

```
yum install -y http://yum.postgresql.org/9.6/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos96-9.6-3.noarch.rpm
```

Make sure to double adapt the previous command with the latest package available
and the PostgreSQL version you need.

We can now install everything we need for our cluster:

```
yum install -y pacemaker postgresql96 postgresql96-contrib postgresql96-server resource-agents pcs fence-agents-all fence-agents-virsh
```

Finally, we need to install the "PostgreSQL Automatic Failover" (PAF) resource agent:

```
yum install -y https://github.com/dalibo/PAF/releases/download/v2.1.0/resource-agents-paf-2.1.0-1.noarch.rpm
```

## PostgreSQL setup

> **WARNING**: building PostgreSQL standby is not the main subject here. The
> following steps are __**quick and dirty**__. They lack of security, WAL
> retention and so on. Rely on the [PostgreSQL documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/index.html)
> for a proper setup.
{: .warning}

> **NOTE**: Moving the `recovery.conf.pcmk` file outside the PGDATA is not
> mandatory. However, this ease the maintenance of the PostgreSQL instance,
> as this avoids recreating these file (or forgetting to edit it) each time
> you have to rebuild a slave instance.
>
> The pgsqlms resource agent has a parameter `recovery_template` to refer to
> a recovery template located in another directory.
>
> You can imagine the same thing for the `pg_hba.conf` file. The parameter
> `hba_file` is helpful to relocate this file to another place.
{: .notice}

The resource agent requires the PostgreSQL instances to be already set up,
ready to start and slaves ready to replicate. Make sure to setup your PostgreSQL
master on your preferred node to host the master: during the very first startup
of the cluster, PAF detects the master based on its shutdown status.

Moreover, it requires a `recovery.conf` template ready to use. You can create
a `recovery.conf` file suitable to your needs, the only requirements are:

  * have `standby_mode = on`
  * have `recovery_target_timeline = 'latest'`
  * a `primary_conninfo` with an `application_name` set to the node name

Here are some quick steps to build your primary PostgreSQL instance and its
standbys. This quick start considers `srv1` is the preferred master. On the
primary:

```
/usr/pgsql-9.6/bin/postgresql96-setup initdb

su - postgres

cat <<EOP >> ~postgres/9.6/data/postgresql.conf

listen_addresses = '*'
wal_level = replica
max_wal_senders = 10
hot_standby = on
hot_standby_feedback = on
EOP

mkdir ~postgres/9.6/etc

cat <<EOP >> ~postgres/9.6/data/pg_hba.conf
# forbid self-replication
host replication postgres 192.168.122.50/32 reject
host replication postgres $(hostname -s) reject

#Â allow any standby connection
host replication postgres 0.0.0.0/0 trust
EOP

cat <<EOP > ~postgres/9.6/etc/recovery.conf.pcmk
standby_mode = on
primary_conninfo = 'host=192.168.122.50 application_name=$(hostname -s)'
recovery_target_timeline = 'latest'
EOP

exit

systemctl start postgresql-9.6
ip addr add 192.168.122.50/24 dev eth0
```

Now, on each standby, clone the primary. E.g.:

```
su - postgres

pg_basebackup -h pgsql-vip -D ~postgres/9.6/data/ -X stream -P

mkdir ~postgres/9.6/etc

sed -ri s/srv[0-9]+/$(hostname -s)/ ~postgres/9.6/data/pg_hba.conf

cat <<EOP > ~postgres/9.6/etc/recovery.conf.pcmk
standby_mode = on
primary_conninfo = 'host=192.168.122.50 application_name=$(hostname -s)'
recovery_target_timeline = 'latest'
EOP

cp ~postgres/9.6/etc/recovery.conf.pcmk ~postgres/9.6/data/recovery.conf

exit

systemctl start postgresql-9.6
```

Finally, make sure to stop the PostgreSQL services __everywhere__ and to
disable them, as Pacemaker will take care of starting/stopping everything for
you during cluster normal cluster operations:

```
systemctl stop postgresql-9.6
systemctl disable postgresql-9.6
```

And remove the master IP address from `srv1`:

```
ip addr del 192.168.122.50/24 dev eth0
```


## Cluster setup


### Pacemaker

It is advised to keep Pacemaker off on server boot. It helps the administrator
to investigate after a node fencing before Pacemaker starts and potentially
enters in a death match with the other nodes. Make sure to disable Corosync as
well to avoid unexpected behaviors. Run this on all nodes:

```
systemctl disable corosync # important!
systemctl disable pacemaker
```


### Cluster creation

This guide uses the cluster management tool `pcsd` provided by RHEL to ease the
creation and setup of a cluster. It allows to create the cluster from command
line, without editing configuration files or XML by hands.

`pcsd` uses the hacluster system user to work and communicate with other
members of the cluster. We need to set a password to this user so it can
authenticate to other nodes easily. As cluster management commands can be run on
any member of the cluster, it is recommended to set the same password everywhere
to avoid confusions:

```
passwd hacluster
```

Enable and start the `pcsd` daemon on all the nodes:

```
systemctl enable pcsd
systemctl start pcsd
```

Now, authenticate each node to the other ones using the following command:

```
pcs cluster auth srv1 srv2 srv3 -u hacluster
```

We can now create our cluster!

```
pcs cluster setup --name cluster_pgsql srv1,srv1-alt srv2,srv2-alt srv3,srv3-alt
```

> **NOTE**: If you don't have an alternative network available (this is really
> not ideal), use the following syntax:
>
> ```
> pcs cluster setup --name cluster_pgsql srv1 srv2 srv3
> ```
{: .notice}

You can now start your cluster!

```
pcs cluster start --all
```


After some seconds of startup and cluster membership stuff, you should be able
to see your three nodes up in `crm_mon` (or `pcs status`):

```
root@srv1:~# crm_mon -n1D
Node srv1: online
Node srv2: online
Node srv3: online
```

We can now feed this cluster with some resources to keep available. This guide
use the cluster client `pcs` to setup everything.


## Cluster resource creation and management

This setup creates three different resources: `pgsql-ha`, `pgsql-master-ip`
and `fence_vm_xxx`.

The `pgsql-ha` resource represents all the PostgreSQL instances of your cluster
and controls where is the primary and where are the standbys.

The `pgsql-master-ip` is located on the node hosting the PostgreSQL master
resource.

The last resources `fence_vm_xxx` are STONITH resources, used to manage fencing.
We create one STONITH resource for each node. Each fencing resource will not be
allowed to run on the node it is supposed to stop. We are using the
`fence_virsh` fencing agent, which is power fencing agent allowing to power on
or off a virtual machine through the `virsh` command. For more information
about fencing, see documentation `docs/FENCING.md` in the source code or
online:
[http://dalibo.github.com/PAF/fencing.html]({{ site.baseurl }}/fencing.html).

First of all, let's create an empty CIB file and fill it with some basic setup.
We will push to the cluster once we are completely done:

```
pcs cluster cib cluster1.xml
pcs -f cluster1.xml resource defaults migration-threshold=5
pcs -f cluster1.xml resource defaults resource-stickiness=10
```

Then, we must start populating it with the STONITH resources. Replace
`<username>` with the system user name on the hypervisor able to manage your
virtual machine: 

```
pcs -f cluster1.xml stonith create fence_vm_srv1 fence_virsh pcmk_host_check="static-list" pcmk_host_list="srv1" ipaddr="192.168.122.1" login="<username>" port="srv1-c7" action="off" identity_file="/root/.ssh/id_rsa"
pcs -f cluster1.xml stonith create fence_vm_srv2 fence_virsh pcmk_host_check="static-list" pcmk_host_list="srv2" ipaddr="192.168.122.1" login="<username>" port="srv2-c7" action="off" identity_file="/root/.ssh/id_rsa"
pcs -f cluster1.xml stonith create fence_vm_srv3 fence_virsh pcmk_host_check="static-list" pcmk_host_list="srv3" ipaddr="192.168.122.1" login="<username>" port="srv3-c7" action="off" identity_file="/root/.ssh/id_rsa"
pcs -f cluster1.xml constraint location fence_vm_srv1 avoids srv1=INFINITY
pcs -f cluster1.xml constraint location fence_vm_srv2 avoids srv2=INFINITY
pcs -f cluster1.xml constraint location fence_vm_srv3 avoids srv3=INFINITY
```

We add the PostgreSQL `pgsqld` resource and the multistate `pgsql-ha`
responsible to clone it everywhere and define the roles (master/slave) of each
clone:

```
# pgsqld
pcs -f cluster1.xml resource create pgsqld ocf:heartbeat:pgsqlms \
    bindir=/usr/pgsql-9.6/bin pgdata=/var/lib/pgsql/9.6/data     \
    recovery_template=/var/lib/pgsql/9.6/etc/recovery.conf.pcmk  \
    op start timeout=60s                                         \
    op stop timeout=60s                                          \
    op promote timeout=30s                                       \
    op demote timeout=120s                                       \
    op monitor interval=15s timeout=10s role="Master"            \
    op monitor interval=16s timeout=10s role="Slave"             \
    op notify timeout=60s

# pgsql-ha
pcs -f cluster1.xml resource master pgsql-ha pgsqld \
    master-max=1 master-node-max=1                  \
    clone-max=3 clone-node-max=1 notify=true
```

Note that the values for `timeout` and `interval` on each operation are based
on the minimum suggested value for PAF Resource Agent. These values should be
adapted depending on the context.

We add the IP address which should be started on the primary node:

```
pcs -f cluster1.xml resource create pgsql-master-ip ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 \
    ip=192.168.122.50 cidr_netmask=24 op monitor interval=10s
```

We now define the collocation between `pgsql-ha` and `pgsql-master-ip`.

> **WARNING**: the start/stop and promote/demote order for these resources must
> be asymetrical: we __must__ keep the master IP on the master during its demote
> process.
{: .warning}

```
pcs -f cluster1.xml constraint colocation add pgsql-master-ip with master pgsql-ha INFINITY
pcs -f cluster1.xml constraint order promote pgsql-ha then start pgsql-master-ip symmetrical=false
pcs -f cluster1.xml constraint order demote pgsql-ha then stop pgsql-master-ip symmetrical=false
```

We can now push our CIB to the cluster, which will start all the magic stuff:

```
pcs cluster cib-push cluster1.xml
```
